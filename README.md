I'm Nikhil Mishra, currently in SYBBACA (Second Year Bachelor of Commerce with a specialization in Accounting and Finance). 
I have a strong interest in financial studies and mathematics, especially in areas like profit and loss, direct variation, 
and interest calculations. I'm also passionate about technology, particularly JavaScript programming and web development.
Right now, I'm working on a project to create a Netflix-like homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating APIs like TMDB.

I prefer simplicity in my work, whether it's in programming or solving math problems.
I like straightforward solutions that are easy to understand and implement. 
I also value a positive and happy environment, which is something I really appreciate in my time at Pramukh Investment.
Overall, I'm focused on blending my skills in finance and technology to build a strong foundation for my future.
